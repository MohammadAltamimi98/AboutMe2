<h2> About Me </h2>


<p id="intro"> Hey ! My name is Mohammad Altamimi, I am 22 years old. I live in Amman, Jordan. I studied Mechanical engineering in the Hashemite university. Although I really like my field of study but when it comes to job prospects, it is extremely hard to find a job that will fully utilize my knowledge and what I have learned throughout the years of study. I was always passionate about <b>CODING AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT</b> but never really persued it until i pumped into an advertisement about a scholarship for software development (currently enrolled in it).</p>


  <p id="sec"> I am a taurus; and that means i really love competition and hard work and I am so excited about my course. My goals in life are pretty simple but pretty demanding as well; I want to leave an imprint  in this world, I love learning so I also want to have a master's degree in engineering and perhaps even get a PhD in mechanical engineering. But, I also want to continue learning about software development and maybe even find a career in that field.</p>
